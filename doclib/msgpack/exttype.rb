    #
    # Make this class the global default target for unpacking unregistered extended types.
    #
    # This is useful in compatibility subclasses of +ExtType+: {Extended}, {ExtendedValue}, {ExtensionValue}.
    #
    # Explicit type registration via {Unpacker#register_exttype} or {Unpacker.register_exttype} always takes precedence over this default.

    # Helper method for safe packing of extended types.
    #
    # It is intended to be used from +to_msgpack+ instance methods
    # to avoid unsafe manual writes to packer buffer during low-level
    # packing.
    #
    # @overload self.pack packer, typenr, data
    #   The fast variant writing directly to _packer_.
    #
    #   @param packer [Integer] the packer to write to.
    #   @param typenr [Integer] the extended type number +0..127+.
    #   @param data [Integer] the extended type data (payload).
    #
    #   @return [Packer] _packer_
    #
    # @overload self.pack typenr, data
    #   The slow variant that creates an ExtType instance and packs it.
    #   This in turn creates a new instance of +Packer+, packs the ExtType and
    #   returns the contents of its buffer as a +String+.
    #
    #   This variant is useful for one-off packing. For repeated packing,
    #   it is recommended to create a permanent +Packer+ instance and use
    #   the above 3-parameter overload.
    #
    #   @param typenr [Integer] the extended type number +0..127+.
    #   @param data [String] the extended type data (payload).

    #
    # @param typenr [Integer] the extended type number +0..127+.
